# Autonomous Tank Robot
A curious little tank robot that loves to explore. Powered by a NodeMCU and guided by LiDAR and inertial sensing units, this robot can operate fully autonomously or in manual mode. It uses a combination of machine learning and control algorithms to navigate its environment.

## User Interface
Connect to Tank Robot's wireless access point and navigate the user interface using your favorite web browser. Tank Robot has a built-in HTTP server that accepts commands and emits events back to the UI in real-time.
