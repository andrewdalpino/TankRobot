# Autonomous Tank Robot
A curious little tank robot that loves to explore. Powered by a NodeMCU and guided by LiDAR and inertial sensing units, this robot can operate fully autonomously or in manual mode. It uses a combination of machine learning and classical control algorithms to navigate its environment.
